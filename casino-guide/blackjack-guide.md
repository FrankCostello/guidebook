##Blackjack Guide

*Player Ownable*: **Yes**

###Introduction
The idea of blackjack is to get to 21 or closer with your cards
without going over. Each card has a different value ranging from 1 to 11.
Every number card is equal to whatever it's number is(2 is equal to 2,
3 is equal to 3, etc..). The "face cards" or Jack, Queen and King are equal
to 10. Aces are where it gets interesting. An Ace can be equal to 1 or 11,
whichever helps you the most. For all practical purposes an Ace is equal to 11
unless it being equal to 11 will make your total score more than 21 in which case
it'll be a 1.

###How To Play
After placing a bet you will be presented with 2 cards and you will see one of the
dealer's cards. Adding the value of your two cards together will give you your total
score. You are presented with 2 options, Hit and Stand. "Hitting" will give you
an additional card while "Standing" will end your turn and being the dealers. 
If you go over 21 the dealer will automatically win and vice versa.
