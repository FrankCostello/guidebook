shady oc's with a starpegasus just to make a little extra money to continue gambling.

Consider:

* Converting all your cash aside a little bit for OC's into gold.

* Giving it away in contests and games.

* Storing it away in a swiss bank

* Donating it to your crew

* Donating it into a contest/game.

* Blocking the casino pages to prevent you from accessing them, this can be done
in several ways including using tools or editing your hosts file all of which can be
easily found on google.

Hopefully your gambling adventures on bootleggers remain enjoyable and you play within
your limits however if you feel as if it may be getting too serious remember that it's
only a game and consider taking a break for a little while.

Happy Gambling!
