##Roulette Guide

###Introduction
The idea of roulette is to bet on numbers or spreads on the board. Each number or
spread has different odds and payouts. There are 49 possible bets one can make.
You can make multiple bets.

###How To Play
As stated above you can make multiple bets as long as all the bets together
do not exceed the max bet set by the casino owner. You can place a bet on specific
colours, rows, columns, numbers or a combination thereof. Once you place you bet, 
spin the wheel. Depending on where the wheel lands will determine the payout, if any.
