###Introduction
The idea of keno is to select 10 numbers from a chart of 80. The computer will select
20 and the more numbers you match, the more you will win.

###How To Play
Simply select 10 numbers from the chart, each number you select
will turn red. To deselect a number, simply click it again. Once you have selected 10
numbers, place your bet. Any numbers the computer selected are blue, your numbers are
in red and any matches are in purple. To continue playing with the same numbers
simply click bet(adjusting your bet if desired). To restart the game simply click reset.
