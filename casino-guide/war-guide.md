*Player Ownable*: No

**Introduction**
The idea of war is to simply have a higher card than the dealer.

**How To Play**
Place your bet. You will recieve a card, if the value of your card
is higher than the dealer you win, otherwise if the dealer has a 
higher valued card, they win. If it is a tie you are given the option
to surrender or double your wager. If you surrender you lose half your bet
if you double you bet you are given another card, if there is another tie
the dealer wins automatically.
